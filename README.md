# TelosEngine
2D and 3D game engine currently being written in C++ and rendered with OpenGL.

## Status
Let's be honest, I have no idea what I'm doing. I've decided to take a break and spend some time in other frameworks and engines to get an idea of what exactly it is that I'm building and for what reason. My main concern has always been obtaining a look and feel that no engine can capture, though maybe I should see if others can achieve this goal.
